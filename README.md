# Daily_Activity_Prediction

Here, different daily activity recognition is performed using accelerometer data placed on different body positions.

Current version of the code is in Matlab format. A future version will include python format.

'Accelerometer_Data' contains the 3D accelerometer sensor data and the 'dataSetDescription_names.txt' contains their descriptions.

By running the Main_Code.m one will be able to obtain F-score and Accuracy for the different ML architectures (SVM, k-NN, Naive Bayes and Decision Tree). In SVM, binary classification for each of the labels were implemented using a customized code.
